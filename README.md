## ðŸ†• Visual Fn::Cidr tool (NEW)

[https://kyhau.github.io/visual-subnet-tools/fncidr.html](https://kyhau.github.io/visual-subnet-tools/fncidr.html)

This tool calculates and shows the potential outputs of the AWS CloudFormation's intrinsic function [`Fn::Cidr`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-cidr.html) (or `!Cidr`), which returns an array of CIDR address blocks.

This tool takes the same input as `!Cidr [ ipBlock, count, cidrBits ]`.
